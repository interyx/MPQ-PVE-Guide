We have some members who have PVE questions and I decided to sit down and give my take on it.  Might as well share it with everyone too!

tl;dr -- get Juggs and R4G, play as fast as you can, and don't push yourself too hard trying to get better rewards.

# What Even Is PVE?

I mean, we all know what it basically is, right?  A bunch of nodes collected together with some light story overtop that everyone skips over.  But how do you get the most points?  Sweet, sweet points?

First, an overview:

A PVE event is one that lasts between 3-7 days, split into different sub-events (subs) that last between 24-48 hours.  There are a set number and they cycle so you'll play the same events over and over (and over and over and over) and get used to them and their difficulty levels.  

To play a PVE event, you go to the Story tab and click on the pane for the event you want to play.  A screen pops up to ask you which Shield Clearance Level (SCL) you want to enter the event in.  This cannot be changed once you enroll.  In general, I would recommend *not* registering as soon as this panel pops up.  I'll explain why later.

When we talk about nodes, we may use the terms T\[#\] or H\[#\], like the T3 node or the H2 node.  "T" stands for "Trivial" and it's the first 3 (or so) nodes in the level.  These are the easy ones.  The "H" is for "Hard" or "Heroic" and these are the ones that are actually a challenge.  The other nodes in here are the "Essential" nodes like the 2E, 3E, 4E, 5E.  This is a node with required characters, like the node with a required 2\* is the 2E node.

# Wait, Which SCL Should I Pick?

That depends on several factors.

* **Your roster** \-- if you don't have a strong roster, going higher SCLs will be more difficult.  SCL 4-6 are geared towards players without good 3-star champs (I'll have some team recommendations farther down in the thread, but basically if you don't have Strange/Cap/IM40 you're going to have trouble in SCL7, let alone higher than that)
* **Desired rewards** \-- The more difficult the game is, the better the rewards are.  However, this comes with a bit of a caveat: if you jack the difficulty up too high, then you won't be able to clear it and you get fewer rewards for both yourself and your alliance.  Also, if you're still rostering your 4-star characters, you get free 4-star covers from progression in SCL7+.  This can be a double-edged sword because you may not be able to roster that character.  It is really important to roster the latest 3 4-star characters, so for new release events especially this should be a priority.
* **How hard do you want it to be?**  Higher SCLs will be more grindy and difficult.  If you don't want to spend all your time trying to clear it, especially with a younger roster, you should go lower and save yourself some pain.
* **Do you have alliance requirements?**  Some alliances require 100% or higher progression and more points is always better.  If you have the 5-star essential and can handle it, the points for the 5E node are worth more in higher SCLs.  On the flip side, if you try one that's too hard you might not be able to clear it and will fall short of your goal.  Know your limitations!
* **How hard is this event?**   Some are much more difficult than others.  If you're not sure about your roster and you're playing **Simulator, Deadpool vs MPQ,** or **Cosmic Chaos** you should drop down the difficulty.  These events suck.

Overall I recommend high 3\* and low 4\* rosters to start in 7.  That's a pretty good baseline difficulty that most players will be able to clear.  As you get stronger and more confident you can try moving up, or if you're having too much trouble you can always move down.  The goal should always be to at least clear progression so you get the most rewards.

# Okay.  Who Should I Use?

The holy grail for PVE is **4\* Rocket and Groot (R4G)/4\* Juggernaut (Juggs)**.  They are extremely good for cutting through goons very quickly because R4G drops seven very strong strike tiles at the start of the match and Juggernaut does boosted match damage, along with whole team damage when you match his colors.  This combination means that the entire enemy team is taking a lot of damage for almost every match you do.  Good choices for the third are:

* 3/4\* Gamora -- she has a couple things going for her.  A) She's a Guardian and that makes R4G's strike tiles stronger.  B) She shares colors with Juggernaut so she won't tank over anyone.  The 4\* one is better because of her great, cheap stun and the ability to actually drop more special tiles.
* Kitty/Nico -- they'll boost your special tiles.  This is better for longer matches like wave nodes because the initial boost Gamora gives is so great that it will take some turns for one of these to surpass it, at least at low levels.
* Polaris -- I think she will be the new queen.  The weakness of this team is that the strike tiles can be matched away and your damage dwindles to nothing.  She can fix this by actually incentivizing you to match your own strikes to make more.

That said, this team can't steamroll literally everything.  There are some characters you need to watch out for and bring a different team to fight.  

* Nightcrawler is immune to Juggs because he doesn't take team damage.
* 4\* Deadpool creates retaliation tiles every time someone else on his team is hit for enough damage.  This will wreck your Juggernaut after a couple turns, especially if 4\* Captain Marvel is there and they have special tiles out.  She powers up special tiles when countdowns go off -- like XPool's 1-turn retaliation countdown.
* 4\* Thanos, Sabretooth, Kraven the Hunter all thrive on enemy special tiles.  Avoid at all costs.

This is why you'll need at least one backup team.  I like Karnak/America because they'll tear through almost anything like a paper towel.  It just isn't as fast as Juggs/R4G so they're the backup.  There are a lot of other combos, so play around!

For younger rosters, while you're still working on your Juggs/R4G, my favorite teams are

* Iron Fist (IF) /Luke Cage (LC) /Scarlet Witch (SWitch) -- this can take a little bit but it hits like a freight train.  SWitch generates a ton of purple, IF turns purple into black, LC uses it to punch everything to death.  My favorite tactic is to save up 15 purple AP so that you can tap IF's purple three times and flood the board with black.  You *can* fire LC's black at 6 but it's much better when you can do it twice in a row because the first one drops a countdown that makes the others stronger.  Be careful that you don't fire IF's purple when you already have more than 12 black because he'll nuke instead.  It's not bad, but suboptimal.  You can also switch out Luke Cage with other black nukes like Cyclops (stronger damage but he might stun himself) or Black Panther (team damage instead of single target damage).
* Doctor Strange/Captain America (Cap)/Iron Man (IM40) -- this team is a powerhouse.  IM40 generates a ton of AP for Cap to start throwing his shield (overwriting any tile on the board like specials or countdowns), Strange fires back every time someone fires a power and his blue is monstrous.  There is some flexibility in here for the third member; some people highly recommend Kamala Khan.  And for great reason!  If you don't need the precise board control that Cap offers, KK will add extra healing on top of the healing Strange is already doing, using fewer health packs overall, and her green nuke is pretty great.  There's also the 3\* Black Widow, Gray Suit Black Widow, who is a very similar character to KK but is very much more precise with her board control and the way she puts green on the board, plus her red can target individual tiles you need to get rid of.  Hawkguy can go in there if there are special tile generators on the enemy team; whenever you match them, he gets blue and purple AP for free which can fuel Strange's stuns and Hawkguy's purple power which has decent direct damage -- it's a 3-turn purple countdown that also spawns strike tiles, which are removed when the countdown goes off.  Even if the countdown gets matched or destroyed, the strikes will stay on the board to power up Strange's retaliation yellow.  The third character offers a lot of different versatility, so play around with it!
* Thanos deserves a mention while we're talking about fast clears.  The 3\* Thanos can wipe out enemies very quickly, but he comes with a caveat: he also does damage to your team.  If you use him for your regular clears you're going to chew through health packs like nobody's business.  When I was in this tier, before I got R4G/Juggs, I would use Thanos with a single 5\* character and the 3\* Rocket and Groot to clear trivial nodes.  The 5\* offers high match damage to hopefully take down the goons really fast, and Court Death will kill the rest.  3RG regenerates health when you match yellow when they're below 25%, which makes it sustainable to keep using them for 12 clears.  The other option is to just use "cannon fodder" characters you don't care about and won't mind if they're damaged until they naturally heal.
* Another strategy is to use teams with true healing to avoid using health packs during long grinds.  Daken, Patch, and previously mentioned 3RG all have true healing, so if you can build a team around them they'll naturally regnerate their health during matches, saving you packs.  It probably won't be the fastest, but while you're working on the 3\* tier I wouldn't worry too much about speed.  Just make sure you get all your progression rewards.

Those teams along with maybe an anti-special team for certain occasions, should be able to clear SCL7.  It might be a little grindy but that's all I needed when I was at that level.  Still you probably want to be a little stronger for the harder events or drop down to 6 if you don't want to have a really bad time.

# How Do I Get The Most Points?

Play fast, pretty much.  PVE in general very heavily incentivizes fast clears.  The first one to get a certain amount of points gets to be higher in the leaderboard, and the one who can start the latest and get the fastest clears at the end wins.

That said, there is still a strategy to the way the points refresh.  You want to play each one until you see a reduced number of points and a timer counting down, then leave it alone until the following day.  For regular nodes, this happens after four clears.  For wave nodes, this happens after two.  Special "Join Forces" nodes that loan you a champed version of the 4\* essential character start refreshing after a single clear.

Occasionally you'll see subs that last for 48 hours, though.  That's when this changes a little bit.

There are a lot more points available in a 48-hr sub because the nodes actually have a time to regenerate their full point values before you start clearing them.  At the time when you would usually start grinding your nodes down to 0, you only want to hit each node a single time to restart the timers, then leave them alone again.  Let them get back up to full, but don't let them sit there too long not regenerating points.  Then, at the end of the second day, do your clears as normal.

The pattern I use to clear my nodes is, I'll hit every node four times in a row (twice for wave nodes) before moving on to the next unlocked node.  Do the regular nodes first, then the essentials.  When all your nodes are on timers, you're done until the next day.  How much time it takes to "grind" all your nodes down to 0 (3 more clears for a total of 7, even though there are only rewards for 6 clears.  The last one is pure points), that depends.  A good benchmark is how long it took to clear them initially, but if you're not paying attention, save an hour or 45 minutes for your final clears.  You'll get a better sense for how long it takes as you play more.  I need about 30 minutes for mine, depending on how hard the event is.  Don't forget about the Join Forces node if it's there and replayable!  There are some points hiding in there, but save it until last because there aren't as many points in there as the other nodes.  You'll grind it down to 0 after about 3-4 clears total.

When you're deciding how to time out your nodes, you want to err on the side of earlier rather than later if you're not sure.  It's better to clear all your points early than start too late and leave some on the table when the sub closes.

# Why Aren't I Getting 100%?

Ok, so in order to 100% clear the event you'll probably need the 2E, the 3E, and the 4E, that's essential characters from 2-4\*.  The first two should be easy, it doesn't take too terribly long to roster all your 2s and 3s.  Before that you probably won't be able to get 100%.  With optimal clears and no 4E you *may* be able to do it but I wouldn't promise anything.  The nice thing about SCL7 is that they give you a cover for the 4\* character you need for free through progression.  Usually you'll get it on the end of the second day, and then you can immediately go clear the locked nodes you left behind and get everything on Day 3.  The point values increase from day to day, so Day 1 has the fewest points available and Day 3 has the most.  This will make up the gap and allow you to at least finish progression.

I have heard from some alliance mates that it is possible to finish 100% progression without the 4\* essential character, but it is difficult.  It requires optimal clears for every node every day and you barely scrape out the number of points needed.  If you have an extra roster slot it's much, much easier to unlock the 4\* essential node and play it for more points.

# Does Playing Higher Get More Points?

Yes and no.  The only node that changes its point values is the 5-star essential node, the 5E.  This one doesn't even show up on SCL6 and it's only worth 100something points in 7.  The point values in 8, 9, and 10 just go up though.  If you don't have the 5E, there's no point difference between playing SCL7 and SCL9 and a whole bunch of difficulty.  Additionally, SCL10 replaces the 2\* node with a "Challenge" node that's worth a lot more points, so the gap gets even wider.

# Wait, What Is 120%?

You'll see this in Alliance recruiting posts, they'll ask for 120% or 1.2x progression.  That means, if full progression for an event is 55,000 they'll want you to score 66,000, for example.  This is mainly to ensure your alliance places where they're aiming for to get the rewards they want.  Full progression is only about 70% of the points available in an event, so doing optimal clears every day should finish progression early and you just keep grinding for points.  You'll also see stuff like 100% progression or 130% progression; this is pretty easy to calculate by just looking at the number of points required for the maximum and multiplying it by that number.

If you want to know how well you've been doing, just take your final score for the event and divide it by the total required for max progression.  This can help a lot when you're shopping for a new alliance.  If you can tell them "for the last five events I've gotten over 120%" it's a much easier way for them to gauge how good of a scorer you will be.

# Ok, But What About Placement Rewards?

We've talked about progression rewards and how nice they are and how to get them.  Going for placement is a different animal, and one you'll want to bring your fastest team for.  Even then, you'll probably be going up against vets with huge, strong rosters and multiple versions of characters so they can grind nodes super fast without healing.  Beating them takes a little bit of strategy, and this is where it gets meta.

PVE events are broken up into different time slices.  Slice 1 (S1) starts first and S5 starts last.  These times will vary based on where you are in the world so the easiest way to refer to them is just by when the slice starts.  When you join an event, you go into the next available bracket "room."  Each room can only hold 1000 people.  When the room fills up, a new room opens.  The heaviest hitters are all preregistered because you get the most points overall that way and it saves precious seconds to not have to click through and select your slice right when it's opening.  So if you can get into the next one, where there aren't a bunch of huge whales taking up the top spots, you can get much better placement for yourself.  This is why I say to not preregister for events, because if you wait for a room to fill up (to "flip") you can get much better rewards for the same amount of effort.

When people reference a slice # and SCL, they do it in a certain way.  The first number is the slice, 1-5.  The second number is the SCL, 4-10.  I play slice 2 SCL 8, so I play **2.8**.  Someone who plays slice 1 SCL 7 plays **1.7**.

The community has a spreadsheet that lists times based on reporting from players in each specific room at

# Did I Miss Anything?

Let me know how this can be refined or if I forgot to go over anything.  This is all my personal opinion and I sat down and pulled it straight out of my brain so I'm sure it can be refined.  Let me know if you have any more questions on other topics as well!
